# Controller Area Network using LPC2129
Vehicle Dashboard using CAN protocol
Problem statement: Traditional vehicle dashboards lack real-time integration of fuel level, turn
indicators, and wiper modes, making it difficult for drivers to monitor and manage these functions
efficiently
Solution: Developed a CAN-based vehicle dashboard using the ARM7 microcontroller to enable
real-time communication between vehicle modules. Integrated ADC for fuel level monitoring and
PWM for controlling wiper modes. Ensured seamless display of turn indicators, fuel status, and wiper
operations for improved driver interface
Implementation: I developed a CAN-based vehicle dashboard using an ARM7 microcontroller, ADC,
and PWM, ensuring real-time monitoring and improved driver control.
